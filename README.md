# Implement of ML Model for Image Classification
This project presents an efficient and interactive image classification system built using a MobileNetV2 model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and deployed with Streamlit. MobileNetV2, a lightweight and computationally efficient convolutional neural network architecture, is optimized for mobile and embedded devices, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. The CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes, serves as the training dataset, offering a robust benchmark for evaluating model performance.

With Streamlit, the project transforms the model into a user-friendly web application, allowing real-time predictions and easy interaction. This combination of a high-performance neural network and an intuitive interface demonstrates the practical deployment of machine learning models, highlighting their potential to bridge technical solutions and end-user applications. The model's versatility and deployment approach make it a valuable contribution to fields like education, rapid prototyping, and image recognition use cases.
